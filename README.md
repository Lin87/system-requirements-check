# System Requirements Check (v1.2.0)

**Requires WordPress Version: 3.0**  
**Tested up to WordPress Version: 4.8.1**

A minimum system requirements plugin that checks for specified version of the operating systems, web browsers, screen resolution, IP addresses, Adobe Flash Player, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Cookie, and Javascript on the client side.
